Thanks you for the great project
regarding the pi magazine. When I
was a child my father used to buy
these kind of magazines and I
miss them, not only for me, but for
the new children who think the only
OS in existence is that thing called
windows, and when they look at
linux just don't know what to do,
even when they are computer related students. Don't ask when they
are confronted with the command
line.

I have read your current issues of
the mag and am delighted with it. It
has been a while since this sort of
publication was available, and I
have been wanting to get into programming for years, even up to the
point of attending college. But with
this I can study at my own pace
and start my own projects. I dont
have a pie as of yet, but intend to
buy the starter pack from Maplin as
soon as I can. Again, thanks.

I was wondering if I could write for
The Mag Pi magazine, I love the
magazine, and I of course love
technology and writing. I was also
one of the first Raspberry Pi users.
Thankyou.

I just wanted you to know that I love
your magazine. It is well laid out
and highly informative. It is the perfect introduction for students, and
also hobbyists to the wonderful
world of Raspberry Pi. Believe me
when I say, you are helping create
the next generation of Engineers,
makers, hackers, and artists. Keep
up the great work.
